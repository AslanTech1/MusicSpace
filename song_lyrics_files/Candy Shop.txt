I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)
You can have it your way, how do you want it
You gon' back that thing up or should i push up on it
Break it down for you now, baby it's simple
If you be a nympho, I'll be a nympho
Got the magic stick, I'm the love doctor
Have your friends teasing you 'bout how sprung I gotcha
Wanna show me how you work it baby, no problem
Get on top then get to bouncing round like a low rider
I'm a seasons vet when it come to this shit
After you work up a sweat you can play with the stick
I'm trying to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, fuckin not in your hands (ha ha)
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)
Give it to me baby, nice and slow
Climb on top, ride it like you in the rodeo
You ain't never heard a sound like this before
Cause I ain't never put it down like this before
I touch the right spot at the right time
Lights on or lights off, she like it from behind
So seductive, you should see the way she wind
Her hips in slow-mo on the floor when we grind
As Long as she ain't stopping, homie I ain't stopping
Dripping wet with sweat man, its on and popping
Ohh I'm trying to explain baby the best way I can
I melt in your mouth girl, fuckin not in your hands (ha ha)
I'll take you to the candy shop
I'll let you lick the lollipop
Go 'head girl, don't you stop
Keep going 'til you hit the spot (woah)
Licking and such
Licking and such
Licking and such
Licking and such...
