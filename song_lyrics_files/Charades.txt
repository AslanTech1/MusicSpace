Yo Fred, been dealin' with a few situations out 'ere man
But, I'm just sorting it all out, that's why I've been a bit quiet
And then
Yeah, I'm active again
You say One
Headie, One
Headie, One (One)
Headie, One
One
Baddies and honeys, no phones in the car
Them man ain't on but they talk like they are (on)
Them man ain't really got no arms
It come like they just been foldin' their arms (arms)
It come like man been playin' Charades
The way man talk with them arms
One day, I'm in the hood tryna pattern out, shh
Next day, I'm recordin' in France
They talk like they are
All I know is money and beef
Don't think I left it all in the past
How these opp boys say they want beef
And they ain't got bread? That's all in their arse
All my young boys got ten or nine
Guess they all wanna chart
Skengs, Rambos, flickys
We got them all in the car (One)
How many man have the gang dem got?
How many time man do it all bait on the mains
Go wish that man's not hot
Still do it in the coat that Big Shaq got (One)
Just done it in my hoodie
Four doors swervin', no A Boogie (twirl, twirl, turn, turn)
I hope I ain't got 'bout the judge, no Judy
Baddies and honeys, no phones in the car
Them man ain't on but they talk like they are (on)
Them man ain't really got no arms
It come like they just been foldin' their arms (arms)
It come like man been playin' Charades
The way man talk with them arms
One day, I'm in the hood tryna pattern out, shh
Next day, I'm recordin' in France
Baddies and honeys, no phones in the car
Them man ain't on but they talk like they are (on)
Them man ain't really got no arms
It come like they just been foldin' their arms (arms)
It come like man been playin' Charades
The way man talk with them arms
One day, I'm in the hood tryna pattern out, shh
Next day, I'm recordin' in France
All I know is money and beef
Don't think I left it all in the past (ooh)
Them man there different to ours
Couldn't see them, then we leave them to last (you lyin')
My young boy was slackin' in the T
I just gave him a kick up the arse (you lyin')
Focus, work rate, progress
Put in that work then he's up
How many man have the gangdem got?
How much residue in my pot?
How much pressure did we put on opps?
How many times did we out the lot?
Feds tryna find my spot
Man tryna right my wrongs
So I just write a song
Two bad B's in the seat and me in the middle
Two Rambo's, symmetry, me in the middle
Rose gold with the VVs in the middle
D&G, had to throw me a jeans in the middle
I know feds hate to see me winnin'
They just wanna see me in the system
All of those times it was runt, now we litty
'Cause my lawyer from Eagle done built it
Bad B's in the seat and me in the middle
Two Rambo's, symmetry, me in the middle
Rose gold with the VVs in the middle
D&G, had to throw me a jeans in the middle (One)
I just done it in my hoodie
Four doors swervin', no A Boogie (twirl, twirl, turn, turn)
I hope I ain't got 'bout the judge, no Judy
Baddies and honeys, no phones in the car
Them man ain't on but they talk like they are
Them man ain't really got no arms
It come like they just been foldin' their arms
It come like man been playin' Charades
The way man talk with them arms
One day, I'm in the hood tryna pattern out, shh
Next day, I'm recordin' in France
Talk like they are
Foldin' their arms
One
Talk with them arms
